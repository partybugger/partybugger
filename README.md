ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @partybugger, 2nd generation product manager @ Ready since May 2022.

My primary directives at this stage of our company's evolution are to identify items of strategic importance for Ready's continued future success, attain org-wide alignment by providing team members sustainable + scalable frameworks for understanding the reasoning behind all major decisions, and creating actionable plans for achieving said objectives.


I enjoy being hands-on and directly contributing, but will prioritize organizational alignment and defer to our subject-matter experts on matters of implementation.


Let's party (after? by?) quashing bugs as they arise.

- not big on trying new tools (if it isn't broken, i.e. actively impeding productivity or runs counter to expected application behavior, I generally won't actively think about or suggest migrating to a new tool or system.)
- if you would like my support in migrating to a new system or process, we should spend some time brainstorming 1) what problem we're trying to solve 2) benefits and drawbacks to the status quo and the new 3) "immediate disruptive cost" of changing and 4) "future ongoing costs" (caused by the new solution not being a perfect fit)
